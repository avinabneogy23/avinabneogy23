I'm Avinab Neogy, a data scientist passionate about transforming complex information into meaningful insights. My journey has sharpened my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using R, Python, and PyTorch. 

I specialize in mechanistic interpretability to understand how models actually work beneath the surface. When I'm not exploring new datasets or solving challenging problems, you'll find me actively contributing to R packages as part of the R Contributors community. I thrive at the intersection of analytical thinking and practical problem-solving, using my technical expertise to build transparent and explainable AI systems.
